# included in your source repository. See the example key
# `super_secret_key` included below.

# Ultimately, these values will be passed as `--extra-vars` to the
# `ansible-playbook` command for provisioning your machine(s). This
# happens either by passing them to Vagrant during the machine
# provisioning step or during a playbook run using the `petra`
# command.
